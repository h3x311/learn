### Overall
印度老哥manager,特别流畅和真诚,让我特别放松,过去都是照本宣科,第一次脱稿回答,过去的input犹如自己的武器一般可以自由的排列组合,但还需要持续的输入和练习.也发现了STAR中我卡点的几个问题.一个是general的opinion(对问题)不太会造句子.2是我的story样本太少,还需要输入.第3是结尾需要用上帝视角来说outcome,适当用number和value(customer value)来包装.第4是结尾可以reverse question来询问是否有疑问和是否需要更加深入.最后就是intro需要更加的abstract和general,不能举太多的例子.
### questions
- wrong..team blocking...difficult problem...failure
- tell me about a conflict with your team
  - requirement could cause app crash, analyse and collect data to prove it
- tell me about a time I am wrong
  - some error hanpened, I thought its not my code, but its mine(shit example)
- tell me a time team blocked you
    - api document not clear, discuss with manager and ask for help
- tell me a difficult problem you met and how you solve it
    - complex accident, identify and solve it by fixing code, do systemtical check with code and through analysis

### Overall
脱稿阅读,这次是同龄的美国小哥，问的问题还是很经典。总体上，需要在例子里强调和不同的team的合作，和自己和组内包括manager的沟通。

- problem solving
  - 举例子，性能优化，通过分解问题，定位问题(感觉需要换个例子，需要继续input素材吧)
- conflict
  - 需求引起性能问题（感觉老说性能有点重复）
- tight timeline
  - 排优先级，及时沟通，MVP
- 为啥换工作
  - 寻求新的机会
- 最challenging的project
  - 讲的dashboard，但没有讲**其中遇到的问题**，下次需要注意

# time
large proj small team, strategy, personally, linear, job board, prioritize tasks. python apis, ios app, in additionally.
to make a long time short.
# limitations

- 把star拆解开准备, task过渡不够自然
- 把optimization的tech process多练习
- 最后的result用metrics来加强(需要练习)
