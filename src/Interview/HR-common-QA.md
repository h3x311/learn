## Introduce Yourself
Hi, My name is dot, I'm a web developer with a degree of computer science. I'd love to create beautiful performant products that offer delightful user experiences. 

I previously worked at autodesk, where I contributed a lot of frontend projects with my ex colleges. 

For example, I created a inventor dashboard which could show the builds details. this help infrastructure team to easily monitor the build status and improve the stability and performance. it also save a lot of time for the developers to find the root cause of the issue. 

I also enjoy learning new tech stuff, 
for example, I used nextjs and nodejs to build a social application named echo. And I also used react to create a Frontend movie application name movie4fun which is inspired by imdb.

 (worked on some personal side projects when I have free time, such as echo and movie4fun.) besides that
As for skill, I have strong experience with javasciprt, typescript, react and redux. 

and it's where I think I'll really be able to help you guys achieve your goal of your product. Thanks for the opportunity of interview.
