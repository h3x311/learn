### JS
- [X] Execution context, especially lexical scope and closures.
- [X] Hoisting, function & block scoping and function expressions & declarations.
- [X] Binding – specifically call, bind, apply and lexical this.
- [X] Object prototypes, constructors and mixins.
- [ ] Handling asynchronous calls with callbacks, promises, await and async.
- [ ] Composition and high order functions.
- [ ] Event delegation and bubbling.
- [ ] Type Coercion using typeof, instanceof and Object.prototype.toString.
- [ ] When to use function declarations and expressions.

### DOM
- [ ] Selecting or finding nodes using `document.querySelector` and in older browsers `document.getElementsByTagName`.
- [ ] Traversal up and down – `Node.parentNode`, `Node.firstChild`, `Node.lastChild`, and `Node.childNodes`.
- [ ] Traversal left and right – `Node.previousSibling` and `Node.nextSibling`.
- [ ] Manipulation – add, remove, copy, and create nodes in the DOM tree. Know operations such as how to change the text content of a node and toggle, remove, or add a CSS classname.
- [ ] Performance – touching the DOM can be expensive when you have many nodes; know about document fragments and node caching.
