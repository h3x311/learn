# How to perform well in Interview

- Step 1: Clarify the problem
    - Repeat it back in your own words
    - Ask about inputs, outputs, edge cases, performance
    - When/if to validate inputs
    - Error handling
- Step 2: Solution Design
    - DON’T CODE YET
    - Consider some example inputs
    - Explain and discuss possible solutions
    - If none of your approaches will work, explain why
    - FOCUS ON TRADEOFFS
    - DISCUSS TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITIES
    - Come to agreement w/ interviewer on solution to try before coding
    - Pseudocode if needed
        - But let interviewer know real code is coming
    - ASK: Do you want me to code this now?
- Step 3: Code
    - TALK THROUGH EVERYTHING
    - Confirm you can use the data structures or libraries you want to use
    - Use data structures generously
        - Existing or of your own creation
    - Step through code with example input
    - Abstract away logic into helper functions that you can write later
        - Later, confirm if the interviewer still wants you to write them
- Step 5: Test Code
    - REVIEW EVERYTHING
    - Carefully analyze bugs before fixing
- Step 5: Optimize
    - Increase performance
    - Add error handling
    - Handle edge cases
        - e.g. Empty input, input of size one, input with duplicates
    - Refactor into multiple functions
- Step 6: Check with interviewer if you’re done
